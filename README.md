# UTU web programming course

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.

The course is worth 5 credits, and the content following the Full stack course by University of Helsinki. The difference between these courses is that while the Fullstack course by the University of Helsinki is an advanced course, this course is an intermediate course, meaning that the topics and completion requrements are not as strict as with the Fullstack course. This also means that while it is possible to substitute this course for the fullstack course, it is not possible the other way around.

The course material is mainly created by University of Helsinki for their Full Stack open MOOC with help from their partners and affiliates Houston Inc, Terveystalo, Elisa, Unity Technologies and Konecranes.

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.
